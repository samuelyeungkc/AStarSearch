# AStarSearch
Written in Python, the script implemented AStar search on graphs. Sample graphs are provided : `t_map` and `my_map`. Sample output are generated according to the `t_map`. Astar search depends on a heuristic function. In the script, there are both heuristic and non-heuristic function. The inclusion of non-heuristic function is to provide a comparison. Using a heuristic fucntion, the shortest path generated are guaranteed to be optimal. A non-heuristic function would not provide the optimal solution.
